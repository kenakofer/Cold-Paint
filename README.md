# Cold Paint
Cold Paint is a competitive 2 player arcade game written in C with SDL2. As a sentient paint blob, your goal is to touch as many objects as possible, painting them your color. When the item is destroyed, points are given to whichever paint blob has it colored. However, the paint blobs are vulnerable to the pool of sodium hydroxide (a caustic paint remover).

Control the white blob with the arrow keys, and the blue blob with WASD.
